                        Data science is a broad field incorporating aspects of mathematics, statistics, and computation to understand and make use of data.
                        The term "data science" is relatively new and doesn't have a precise definition, but there is significant overlap with "artificial intelligence" and "machine learning".
                        There are two main types of data: numerical data and categorical data.
                        Often different techniques are required to work with each type, although it is usually possible to convert back and forth between the two types.

                        In practice, there are two types of tasks to accomplish: supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
                        Supervised learning seeks to learn a function which maps input data to output data.
                        Unsupervised learning seeks to discover patterns in input data.

                        The methods used to accomplish a learning task can be classified according to: their ability to update when given additional data and their level of abstractness.
                        In batch learning, the learning process must start from sratch to incorporate new data.
                        In online learning, the learning process will build on what has been learned previously.
                        Instance-based learning involves no abstraction and consists of rote memorization of data.
                        Model-based learning hypothesizes an abstract model which is fit to the data.
